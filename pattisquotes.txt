Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.
- H. Abelson and G. Sussman (in "The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs)

The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology--the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects.
- H. Abelson and G. Sussman (in "The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs)

We have also obtained a glimpse of another crucial idea about languages and program design. This is the approach of stratified design, the notion that a complex system should be structured as a sequence of levels that are described using a sequence of languages. Each level is constructed by combining parts that are regarded as primitive at that level, and the parts constructed at each level are used as primitives at the next level. The language used at each level of a stratified design has primitives, means of combination, and means of abstraction appropriate to that level of detail.

Here is how a true educator deals with a problem.
The principal of a small middle school had a problem with a few of the older girls, who were starting to use lipstick. They were applying it in the bathroom, and then they would press their lips to the mirror to smooth it out, leaving lip prints.

He invited the girls to the ladies room, where they met with the custodian. He said he wanted them to witness just how hard it was to clean these mirrors.

The custodian took a long brush on a handle out of a box, dipped it into the nearest toilet, moved to the mirror, and proceeded to scrub it with the brush.

That was the last day the girls pressed their lips on the mirror.

The huge printing presses of a major Chicago newspaper began malfunctioning on the Saturday before Christmas, putting all the revenue for advertising that was to appear in the Sunday paper in jeopardy. None of the technicians could track down the problem. Finally, a frantic call was made to the retired printer who had worked with these presses for over 40 years. "We'll pay anything; just come in and fix them," he was told.
When he arrived, he walked around for a few minutes, surveying the presses; then he approached one of the control panels and opened it. He removed a dime from his pocket, turned a screw 1/4 of a turn, and said, "The presses will now work correctly." After being profusely thanked, he was told to submit a bill for his work.

The bill arrived a few days later, for $10,000.00! Not wanting to pay such a huge amount for so little work, the printer was told to please itemize his charges, with the hope that he would reduce the amount once he had to identify his services. The revised bill arrived: $1.00 for turning the screw; $9,999.00 for knowing which screw to turn.

Commentary: most debugging problems are fixed easily; identifying the location of the problem is hard.

I can only think that the book is read because it deals with the difficulties of schooling, which do not change. Please note: the difficulties, not the problems. Problems are solved or disappear with the revolving times. Difficulties remain. It will always be difficult to teach well, to learn accurately; to read, write, and count readily and competently; to acquire a sense of history and start one's education or anothers.
- J. Barzun ("Begin Here", pp 14),

The American university is built on two false premises: that all teachers must add to the existing stock of knowledge by research, and that all self-respecting institutions fulfill this role only by employing productive scholars...Of course, the teacher must keep reading and thinking abreast of his time, but this does not mean that he must write and publish. The confusion hides a further absurd assumption, which is that when a man writes a scholarly book that reaches a dozen specialists he adds immeasurably to the world's knowledge; whereas if he imparts his thoughts and his reading to one hundred and fifty students every year, he is wasting his time and leaving the world in darkness. One is tempted to ask what blinkered pedant ever launched the notion that students in coming to college seceded from the human race and may therefore be safely left out when knowledge is being broadcast.
- J. Barzun ("Teacher in America"),

The sole justification of teaching, of the school itself, is that the student comes out of it able to do something he could not do before. I say do and not know, because knowledge that doesn't lead to doing something new or doing something better is not knowledge at all.

The truth is, when all is said and done, one does not teach a subject, one teaches a student how to learn it. Teaching may look like administering a dose, but even a dose must be worked on by the body if it is to cure. Each individual must cure his or her own ignorance.

Software development has been, is, and will likely remain fundamentally hard. Building quality systems involves an essential and irreducible complexity, which is why the entire history of software engineering can be characterized as one of rising levels of abstraction. As such, the task of the software development team is to engineer the illusion of simplicity. Nonetheless, software-intensive systems can amplify human intelligence, but they cannot replace human judgment; software-intensive systems can fuse, co-ordinate, classify, and analyze information, but they cannot create knowledge. In other words, not everything we want to build can be built: there exist pragmatic theoretical and technical limits that make software development hard if not impossible. Furthermore, not everything we want to build should be built: there exist moral economic, social, and political limits that govern human industry. From fundamental to human, these are the factors that define the limits of software, factors that separate our vision from execution.

The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures. Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself. It prints results, draws pictures, produces sounds, moves arms. The magic of myth and legend has come true in our time. One types the correct incantation on a keyboard, and a display screen comes to life, showing things that never were nor could be. ... The computer resembles the magic of legend in this respect, too. If one character, one pause, of the incantation is not strictly in proper form, the magic doesn't work. Human beings are not accustomed to being perfect, and few areas of human activity demand it. Adjusting to the requirement for perfection is, I think, the most difficult part of learning to program.

Mathematical truth is not totally objective. If a mathematical statement is false, there will be no proofs, but if it is true, there will be an endless variety of proofs, not just one! Proofs are not impersonal, they express the personality of their creator/discoverer just as much as literary efforts do. If something important is true, there will be many reasons that it is true, many proofs of that fact. Math is the music of reason, and some proofs sound like jazz, others sound like a fugue. Which is better, the jazz or the fugue? Neither: it's all a matter of taste...each proof will emphasize different aspects of the problem, each proof will lead in a different direction. Each one will have different corollaries, different generalizations...Mathematical facts are not isolated, they are woven into a vast spider's web of interconnections.

When the words are fuzzy, the programmers reflexively retreat to the most precise method of articulation available: source code.

So the situation frequently crops up where nomenclature confusion drives programmers to begin coding prematurely, and that code becomes the de facto design, regardless of its appropriateness or correctness.

As long as there were no machines, programming was no problem at all; when we had a few weak computers, programming became a mild problem, and now [1972] that we have gigantic computers, programming has become a gigantic problem. As the power of available machines grew by a factor of more than a thousand, society's ambition to apply these new machines grew in proportion, and it was the poor programmer who found his job in this exploded field of tension between the ends and the means. The increased power of the hardware, together with the perhaps more dramatic increase in its reliability, made solutions feasible that the programmer had not dared to dream about a few years before. And now, a few years later, he had to dream about them and even worse, he had to transform such dreams into reality! It is no wonder that we found ourselves in a software crisis

- E. Dijkstra (in "The Humble Programmer", his 1972 Turing Award Lecture)

Yes, I share your concern: how to program well -though a teachable topic- is hardly taught. The situation is similar to that in mathematics, where the explicit curriculum is confined to mathematical results; how to do mathematics is something the student must absorb by osmosis, so to speak. One reason for preferring symbol-manipulating, calculating arguments is that their design is much better teachable than the design of verbal/pictorial arguments. Large-scale introduction of courses on such calculational methodology, however, would encounter insurmountable political problems.
- E. Dijkstra (in Answers to Questions from Students of Software Engineering)

Text is linear; it is black and white; it doesn't zoom around the page in 3-D; it isn't intelligent by itself; in fact, in terms of immediate reaction it is quite boring. I can't imagine a single preliterate was ever wowed at the first sight of text, and yet text has been the basis of arguably the most fundamental intellectual transformation of the human species. It and its subforms, such as algebra, have made science education for all a plausible goal.

In a fixed mindset students believe their basic abilities, their intelligence, their talents, are just fixed traits. They have a certain amount and that's that, and then their goal becomes to look smart all the time and never look dumb. In a growth mindset students understand that their talents and abilities can be developed through effort, good teaching and persistence. They don't necessarily think everyone's the same or anyone can be Einstein, but they believe everyone can get smarter if they work at it.

In those days [batch processing] programmers never even documented their programs, because it was assumed that nobody else would ever use them. Now, however, time-sharing had made exchanging software trivial: you just stored one copy in the public repository and thereby effectively gave it to the world. Immediately people began to document their programs and to think of them as being usable by others. They started to build on each others work.

Thus, writing a clever piece of code that works is one thing; designing something that can support a long-lasting business is quite another. Commercial software design and production is, or should be, a rigorous, capital-intensive activity. Software products should be based on a broad, deep structure that can support much more than whatever the product contains at any given time. In addition to code that works, you need documentation, help functions, error handling, multi-platform support, and multiple languages. You also need an underlying architecture that allows you to add and change features, purchase and integrated external software components, and allows other software vendors to make their products talk to yours, add customized widgets to it, embed your product inside something larger of their own. A good architecture, one that will carry you for a decade's worth of unpredictable technology and marked changes, take months to develop. But if you skip this step, as Netscape did, you have made a truly Faustian bargain.
The problem with this [building just what you need, instead of planning ahead] is that these systems start getting ferociously complicated. It comes time to fix a mistake, add a feature, replace something and you discover that everything is connected to everything else in ways you can't even begin to understand. Because you're doing something more ambitious than the initial academic prototype, it's big enough that you need to partition it across a team. The members of the team need to have a clear idea of how their work relates to everyone else's, and they need to be able to communicate to the testers whose job it is to find errors. Otherwise [in other words], you give the patient a kidney transplant and his heart suddenly fails; then you give him a heart drug, but that makes his lungs collapse. You don't know why, and you're screwed.

And then the future comes, and you're really screwed. Later releases of the product inevitably are more complex, because they must continue to support previous version while adding new capabilities. You discover that the original developers have quit or been promoted or have forgotten what they did, and it's time to keep up with the competition by adding new features, supporting more platforms, translating into Japanese, and so forth. The engineering team has to quadruple in size. You start discovering things like three different groups need to change the same piece of code, and each set of changes causes problems for the others, and nobody else can test their work until that piece of code is stable, so a hundred people twiddle their thumbs for a week. Or you want to use an existing function for some new purpose, but you can't isolate it from everything else, so you have to write it all over again. This not only means that you have the extra time and cost of writing and maintaining twice as much code, but you probably have to ensure that the two versions work exactly alike, which they almost certainly won't.

With each successive release, these problems get worse. By the time you're on your fifth release, the decision to do your first product the quick and dirty way has probably cost you ten times what it originally saved. A program like Microsoft's Windows 98 is tens of millions of lines of code. Nobody can keep that much complexity in their head or hope to manage it effectively. So you need an architecture that says to everyone, "Here's how this thing works, and to do your part, you need to understand only these five things, and don't you dare touch anything else."

- C. Ferguson (High Stakes, No Prisoners; Times Business Press, page 107-109)

I can live with doubt and uncertainty. I think it's much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong... In physics the truth is rarely perfectly clear, and that is certainly universally the case in human affairs. Hence, what is not surrounded by uncertainty cannot be the truth.
- R. Feynman (in "Perfectly Reasonable Deviations from the Beaten Track: The Letters of Richard P. Feynman")

If you're teaching a class, you can think about the elementary things that you know very well. These things are kind of fun and delightful. It doesn't do any harm to think them over again. Is there a better way to present them? The elementary things are easy to think about; if you can't think of a new thought, no harm done; what you thought about it before is good enough for the class. If you do think of something new, you're rather pleased that you have a new way of looking at it.
The questions of the students are often the source of new research. They often ask profound questions that I've thought about at times and then given up on, so to speak, for a while. It wouldn't do me any harm to think about them again and see if I can go any further now. The students may not be able to see the thing I want to answer, or the subtleties I want to think about, but they remind me of a problem by asking questions in the neighborhood of that problem. It's not so easy to remind yourself of these things.

Habitability is the characteristic of source code that enables programmers coming to the code later in its life to understand its construction and intentions and to change it comfortably and confidently... Software needs to be habitable because it always has to change...Programs are written and maintained, bugs are fixed, features are added, performance is tuned, and a whole variety of changes are made both by the original and new programming team members... What is important is that it be easy for programmers to come up to speed with the code, to be able to navigate through it effectively, to be able to understand what changes to make, and to be able to make them safely and correctly.

A really good language should be both clean and dirty: cleanly designed, with a small core of well understood and highly orthogonal operators, but dirty in the sense that it lets hackers have their way with it....A real hacker's language will always have a slightly raffish character.
- P. Graham (in "Hackers and Painters" pg. 204)

Fixing fresh bugs is easier than fixing old ones. It's usually fairly quick to find a bug in code you just wrote. When it turns up you often know what's wrong before you even look at the source, because you were already worrying about it subconsciously. Fixing a bug in something you wrote six months ago (the average case if you release once a year) is a lot more work. And since you don't understand the code as well, you're more likely to fix it in an ugly way, or even introduce more bugs.
When you catch bugs early, you also get fewer compound bugs. Compound bugs are two separate bugs that interact: you trip going downstairs, and when you reach for the handrail it come off in your hand. In software this kind of bug is the hardest to find, and also tends to have the worst consequences. The traditional "break everything and then filter out the bugs" approach inherently yields a lot of compound bugs. And software released in a series of small chances inherently tends not to. The floors are constantly being swept clean of any loose objects that might later get stuck to something.

- P. Graham (in "Hackers and Painters" pg. 65-66)

Great software, likewise, requires a fanatical devotion to beauty. If you look inside good software, you find that parts that no one is ever supposed to see are beautiful too. When it comes to code I behave in a way that would make me eligible for prescription drugs if I approached everyday life the same way. It drives me crazy to see code that's badly indented, or that uses ugly variable names.
- P. Graham (in "Hackers and Painters" pg. 29)

Imagine the kind of conversation you would have with someone so far away that there was a transmission delay of one minute. Now imagine speaking to someone in the next room. You wouldn't just have the same conversation faster, you would have a different kind of conversation. In Lisp, developing software is like speaking face-to-face. You can test code as you're writing it. And instant turnaround has just as dramatic an effect on development as it does on conversation. You don't just write the same program faster; you write a different kind of program.
- P. Graham (in "On Lisp")

Simplicity is the most important thing in technology. And it's only getting more important.

The difference between design and research seems to be a question of the good versus the new. Design doesn't have to be new, but it has to be good. Research doesn't have to be good, but it has to be new. I think these two paths converge at the top: the best design surpasses its predecessors by using new ideas, and the best research solves problems that are not only new, but worth solving. So ultimately design and research are aiming for the same destination, just approaching it from different directions.
- P. Graham (in "Hackers and Painters" footnote 9, pg. 224)

The way to make programs easy to read is not to stuff them with comments... A good programming language ought to be better for explaining software than English. You should only need comments when there is some kind of kludge you need to warn readers about, just as on a road there are only arrows on parts with unexpectedly sharp curves.
- P. Graham (in "Hackers and Painters" footnote 9, pg. 224)

You should figure our programs as you're writing them, just as writers and painters and architects do. Realizing this [programming as sketching] has real implications for software design. It means that a programming language should, above all, be malleable. A programming language is for thinking of programs, not for expressing programs you've already thought of. It should be a pencil, not pen.
...
Remember too that languages are not primarily a form for finished programs, but something that programs have to be developed in.
...
A good programming language should, like oil paint, make it easy to change your mind.
...
Paintings usually begin with a sketch. Gradually the details get filled in. But it is not merely a process of filling in. Sometimes the original plans turn out to be mistaken. Countless paintings, when you look at them in x-rays, turn out to have limbs that have been moved or facial features that have been readjusted.
...
So the test of a language is not simply how clean the finished program looks in it, but how clean the path to the finished program was.
...
What made oil paint so exciting, when it first became popular in the fifteenth century, was that you could make the finished work from the prototype. You could make a preliminary drawing if you wanted to, but you weren't held to it; you could work out all the details, and even make major changes as you finished the painting. You can do this with software too. A prototype doesn't have to be just a model; you can refine it into the finished product....it's good for morale.
...
Building something by gradually refining a prototype is good for morale because it keeps you engaged. In software, my rule is: always have working code. If you're writing something you'll be able to test in an hour, you have the prospect of an immediate reward to motivate you.
- P. Graham (in "Hackers and Painters" pg. 22, 27, 218, 219, 220, 221)

Incidentally, when we're faced with a "prove or disprove," we're usually better off trying first to disprove with a counterexample, for two reasons: A disproof is potentially easier (we need just one counterexample); and nitpicking arouses our creative juices. Even if the given assertion is true, our search for a counterexample often leads to a proof, as soon as we see why a counterexample is impossible. Besides, it's healthy to be skeptical.

It is very interesting to me how quickly the class has divided up into three factions. One faction being the students who sit in the back of the class, given up sitting in their assigned seats, preparing the cases. What is it, only October? They've already given up trying -the cowards. The second group are the ones who won't raise their hands or volunteer an answer, but will try when they're called upon. That's where I am right now, living in a state of constant fear. And then there's the third echelon: the upper echelon; the volunteers. They raise their hands in class. They thrust themselves into the fray. I don't think they're smarter than anyone else, but they have courage. And, they'll achieve the final recognition, that teachers will get to know their names, and they'll get better grades. The past couple weeks I've been preparing to enter the upper echelon, and this weekend -if I can get all my work done- I'm going to enter it Monday morning, in Kingsfield's contract law class.

- P.Hein (in "Grooks")

There are two schools of thought about teaching computer science. We might caricature the two views this way:
The conservative view: Computer programs have become too large and complex to encompass in a human mind. Therefore, the job of computer science education is to teach people how to discipline their work in such a way that 500 mediocre programmers can join together and produce a program that correctly meets its specification.
The radical view: Computer programs have become too large and complex to encompass in a human mind. Therefore, the job of computer science education is to teach people how to expand their minds so that the programs can fit, by learning to think in a vocabulary of larger, more powerful, more flexible ideas than the obvious ones. Each unit of programming thought must have a big payoff in the capabilities of the program.

It's [programming] the only job I can think of where I get to be both an engineer and an artist.

...At first I hoped that such a technically unsound project would collapse but I soon realized it was doomed to success. Almost anything in software can be implemented, sold, and even used given enough determination. There is nothing a mere scientist can say that will stand against the flood of a hundred million dollars. But there is one quality that cannot be purchased in this way -and that is reliability. The price of reliability is the pursuit of the utmost simplicity. It is a price which the very rich find most hard to pay.

I had the idea to define programming languages in a way that gave enough information to the user of the programming language to be able to predict whether the computer would do what hte programming wanted it to.

What is the central core of the subject [computer science]? What is it that distinguishes it from the separate subjects with which it is related? What is the linking thread which gathers these disparate branches into a single discipline. My answer to these questions is simple -it is the art of programming a computer.

It is the art of translating this design into an effective and accurate computer program.

Using a language we may create models of phenomena of interest, and by using models, phenomena may be studied for purposes of understanding or prediction. Models may be used for analysis focused on a close examination of individual parts of the model and for synthesis aimed at understanding the interplay of the parts, that is, understanding the model as a whole. A novel is like a model of the real world expressed in a written language like English. In a novel, the characters may be analyzed and the interaction between people may be displayed and studied.

Computer Science is the only discipline in which we view adding a new wing to a building as being maintenance.
- J. Horning

To treat programming scientifically, it must be possible to specify the required properties of programs precisely. Formality is certainly not an end in itself. The importance of formal specifications must ultimately rest in their utility -in whether or not they are used to improve the quality of software or to reduce the cost of producing and maintaining software.

One purpose of CRC cards [a design tool] is to fail early, to fail often, and to fail inexpensively. It is a lot cheaper to tear up a bunch of cards that it would be to reorganize a large amount of source code.

There were really just two main things [relating to programming languages]. One was simplicity and the other was practicality. But when after 16 years [in 1995] we're still fighting to teach the world about these simple things,..., you begin to realize the siple things are not obvious.

"Learning to program teaches you how to think. Computer science is a liberal art"
- S. Jobs

That simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. What we meant by that was when you start looking at a problem and it seems really simple with all these simple solutions, you don't really understand the complexity of the problem. And your solutions are way too oversimplified, and they don't work. Then you get into the problem, and you see it's really complicated. And you come up with all these convoluted solutions. That's sort of the middle, and that's where most people stop, and the solutions tend to work for a while. But the really great person will keep on going and find, sort of, the key, underlying principle of the problem. And come up with a beautiful elegant solution that works.
- S. Jobs (in "The Perfect Thing" by Steven Levy, pg. 67-68)

That's been one of my mantras -focus and simplicity. Simple can be harder than complex: you have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it's worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.
- S. Jobs (BusinessWeek interview, May 1998)

The only problem with Microsoft is they just have no taste. They have absolutely no taste. What that means is -I don't mean that in a small way; I mean that in a big way- is the sense that they don't think of original ideas. They don't bring much culture into their product. ... So I guess I am saddened not by Microsoft's success -I have no problem with their success; they've earned their success (for the most part). I have a problem with the fact that the just make really third-rate products.

We don't manage our time as well as we manage our space. There's an overhead of starting and an overhead of stopping a project because you kind of lose your momentum. And you've got to bracket and put aside all the things you're already doing. So you need reasonably large blocks of uninterrupted time if you're going to be successful at doing some of these things. That's why hackers tend to stay up late.
If you stay up late and you have another hour of work to do, you can just stay up another hour later without running into a wall and having to stop. Whereas it might take three or four hours if you start over, you might finish if you just work that extra hour. If you're a morning person, the day always intrudes a fixed amount of time in the future. So it's much less efficient. Which is why I think computer people tend to be night people -because a machine doesn't get sleepy.

Once we start learning something, it is very hard for us to see what else is going on... Probably the most disastrous thing that you can ever learn is your first programming language, even if it is a good programming language. And the reason is that it tends to become computing. [And] So it might be a better idea to learn two or three programming languages at the same time, even though that is a different kind of struggle, but it would at least relativize what people think computing might be.

Until real software engineering is developed, the next best practice is to develop with a dynamic system that has extreme late binding in all aspects.

If you have a large number of unrelated ideas, you have to get quite a distance away from them to get a view of all of them, and this is the role of abstraction. If you look at each too closely you see too many details. If you get far away things may appear simpler because you can only see the large, broad outlines; you do not get lost in petty details.

Act in haste and repent at leisure; code too soon and debug forever.
- R. Kennington

Carver [Mead] had a gift for telling a carefully callibrated sequence of lies about how circuits worked. The simplest version was that when a red line crossed over a green line, that made a transistor. Of course this gross over-simplification was unmasked, to be replace by another more sohisticaed lie, which in turn would be further refined. As a result of this excellent instruciton, everyone in Carver's class [on VLSI design] was able to design and build some kind of experimental chip after a couple of weeks of training.
- B. Kernighan (in Unix a History and Memoir, pp. 127)

People sometimes talk of software productivity in term of the number of line of code written: in the Unix world, productivity was often measured by the number of special cases or lines of code that were removed.

- B. Kernighan

The most effective debugging tool is still careful thought, coupled with judiciously placed print statements.
- B. Kernighan

Another effective [debugging] technique is to explain your code to someone else. This will often cause you to explain the bug to yourself. Sometimes it takes no more than a few sentences, followed by an embarrassed "Never mind, I see what's wrong. Sorry to bother you." This works remarkably well; you can even use non-programmers as listeners. One university computer center kept a teddy bear near the help desk. Students with mysterious bugs were required to explain them to the bear before they could speak to a human counselor.

Can writing be taught? It can be learned, but I'm not sure it can be taught. It's a self-taught kind of thing.
- S. King (writer; answering a question when interviewed on PBS)

The study of law is something new and unfamiliar to most of you -unlike any schooling you have ever been through before. We use the Socratic method here: I call on you, ask you a question, and you answer it. Why don't I just give you a lecture? Because through my questions you learn to teach yourselves. Through this method of questioning-answering, questioning-answering, we seek to develop in you the ability to analyze that vast complex of facts that constitute the relationships of members within a given society.
Questioning and answering. At times, you may feel that you have found the correct answer. I assure you that this is a total delusion on your part. You will never find the correct, absolute, and final answer. In my classroom, there is always another question, another question to follow your answer. Yes, you are on a treadmill. My little questions spin the tumblers of your mind. You are on an operating table; my little questions are the fingers probing your brain. We do brain surgery here. You teach yourselves the law, but I train your mind. You come in here with a skull full of mush, and you leave thinking like a lawyer.

Computers are good at following instructions, but not at reading your mind.
- D. Knuth (Tex, pg. 9)

Debugging is an art that needs much further study .... The most effective debugging techniques seem to be those which are designed and built into the program itself -many of today's best programmers will devote nearly half of their programs to facilitating the debugging process on the other half; the first half... will eventually be thrown away, but the net result is a surprising gain in productivity.
Another good debugging practice is to keep a record of every mistake that is made. Even though this will probably be quite embarrassing, such information is invaluable to anyone doing research on the debugging problem, and it will also help you learn how to reduce the number of future errors.

- D. Knuth (The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 1)

Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs. Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.
- D. Knuth

...methods are more important than facts. The educational value of a problem given to a student depends mostly on how often the thought processes that are invoked to solve it will be helpful in later situations. It has little to do with how useful the answer to the problem may be. On the other hand, a good problem must also motivate the students; they should be interested in seeing the answer. Since students differ so greatly, I cannot expect everyone to like the problems that please me.
- D. Knuth (in "Are Toy Problems Useful", Chapter 10 of "Selected Papers on Computer Science", pg. 176)

...One of the most important lessons, perhaps, is the fact that SOFTWARE IS HARD. From now on I shall have significantly greater respect for every successful software tool that I encounter. During the past decade I was surprised to learn that the writing of programs for TeX and Metafont proved to be much more difficult than all the other things I had done (like proving theorems or writing books). The creation of good software demands a significantly higher standard of accuracy than those other things do, and it requires a longer attention span than other intellectual tasks.

When I speak about computer programming as an art, I am thinking primarily of it as an art form, in an aesthetic sense. The chief goal of my work as an educator and author is to help people learn how to write beautiful programs...My feeling is that when we prepare a program, the experience can be just like composing poetry or music...Some programs are elegant, some are exquisite, some are sparkling. My claim is that it is possible to write grand programs, noble programs, truly magnificent ones!...computer programming is an art, because it applies accumulated knowledge to the world, because it requires skill and ingenuity, and especially because it produces objects of beauty. Programmers who subconsciously view themselves as artists will enjoy what they do and will do it better.
- D. Knuth (Computer Programming as an Art. Turing Award Speech 1974)

When certain concepts of TeX are introduced informally, general rules will be stated; afterwards you will find that the rules aren't strictly true. In general, the later chapters contain more reliable information than the earlier ones do. The author feels that this technique of deliberate lying will actually make it easier for you to learn the ideas. Once you understand a simple but false rule, it will not be hard to supplement that rule with its exceptions.

There is a race between the increasing complexity of the systems we build and our ability to develop intellectual tools for understanding their complexity. If the race is won by our tools, then systems will eventually become easier to use and more reliable. If not, they will continue to become harder to use and less reliable for all but a relatively small set of common tasks. Given how hard thinking is, if those intellectual tools are to succeed, they will have to substitute calculation for thought.

"Where have you performed?" Murray asked me from behind a copy of Variety. "Well, I don't perform, exactly," I answered, "but I have spoken at synagogues, and I lecture from time to time at colleges and universities."
"Universities?" Murray sputtered. "Did he say universities? Worst audience in the world. I spoke at a university once. They invited me to speak about the hotel industry. Believe me, I've got a pretty good routine on this; I've used it many times before, and I know where I'm supposed to get reactions: chuckles, laughs, applause. Son of a bitch, I stand up there and it's a grim audience! All these young people in jeans and sneakers. I open it up for questions. These bastards are dead serious -they're taking notes! I realized later, they weren't an audience, they were students. They take notes and get grades. They're not there to laugh. Who wants to perform for an audience like that?"

We think only through the medium of words. Languages are true analytical methods.

A vivid confirmation of this analysis [the importance of extra-curricular activities] occurred during a lunchtime conversation I had with three computer science graduates of the classes of 1994/1995 who started a company together and sold it in 1998 for more than $250 million. Over sandwiches I asked them what part of their computer science education had been most important to the success of their software enterprise. After a moment of tight smiles and awkward silence, one of the young graduates spoke up. "The computer science courses I took were really terrific," he said in an attempt to reassure me, "but I didn't learn much that I could not have learned on my own. The most important things I learned were from managing the Quincy House Grill." It made perfect sense -hiring, firing, and inspiring colleagues, working under pressure in close quarters- all were very much the same in the cheeseburger-flipping business he had run at Harvard as in the software business the three had started in a tiny apartment.

...fielding statistics made sense only as numbers, not as language. Language, not numbers, is what interested him [Bill James, a baseball writer]. Words, and the meaning they were designed to convey.

Composing computer programs to solve scientific problems is like writing poetry. You must choose every word with care and link it with the other words in perfect syntax. There is no place for verbosity or carelessness. To become fluent in a computer language demands almost the antithesis of modern loose thinking. It requires many interactive sessions, the hands-on use of the device. You do not learn a foreign language from a book, rather you have to live in the country for year to let the language become an automatic part of you, and the same is true for computer languages.

Testing by itself does not improve software quality. Test results are an indicator of quality, but in and of themselves, they don't improve it. Trying to improve software quality by increasing the amount of testing is like try to lose weight by weighing yourself more often. What you eat before you step onto the scale determines how much you will weigh, and the software development techniques you use determine how many errors testing will find. If you want to lose weight, don't buy a new scale; change your diet. If you want to improve your software, don't test more; develop better.

The only way for errors to occur in a program is by being put there by the author. No other mechanisms are known. Programs can't acquire bugs by sitting around with other buggy programs. Right practice aims at preventing insertion of errors and, failing that, removing them before testing or any other running of the program.

A computer is like a violin. You can imagine a novice trying first a phonograph and then a violin. The latter, he says, sounds terrible. That is the argument we have heard from our humanists and most of our computer scientists. Computer programs are good, they say, for particular purposes, but they aren't flexible. Neither is a violin, or a typewriter, until you learn how to use it.

Between 1892 say, and 1904, movies were made by the cameraman because he understood the equipment. And that is exactly where we are now [in software design]. In 1904 they invented the director; what was the director? It was the guy who didn't have to know how to load the camera didn't have to know how to sew costumes, play a violin, dance, fence, or hang the lights. But, he had to know how to make those effects come together in a unified experience... Why are video games so much better designed than office software? Video games are designed by people who love to play video games. Office software is designed by people who want to do something else on the weekend... What does show business teach you? It teaches you that design is war; it is a power struggle between the producers, directors, authors, everyone who wants to be involved.

In mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them.
- J. von Neumann

The sciences do not try to explain, they hardly even try to interpret, they mainly make models. By a model is meant a mathematical construct which, with the addition of certain verbal interpretations, describes observed phenomena. The justification of such a mathematical construct is solely and precisely that it is expected to work - that is correctly to describe phenomena from a reasonably wide area. Furthermore, it must satisfy certain esthetic criteria - that is, in relation to how much it describes, it must be rather simple.
- J. von Neumann

Millions for compilers, but hardly a penny for understanding human programming language use. Now, programming languages are obviously symmetrical, the computer on one side, the human on the other. In an appropriate science of computer languages, one would expect that half the effort would be on the computer side, understanding how to translate the languages into executable form, and half on the human side, understanding how to design languages that are easy or productive to use. Yet, we do not even have an enumeration of all the psychological functions programing languages serve for the user. Of course, there is lots of programming language design, but it comes from computer scientists. And though technical papers on languages contain mainly appeals to ease of use and learning, they patently contain almost no psychological evidence nor any appeal to psychological science.

The discipline of programming is most like sorcery. Both use precise language to instruct inanimate objects to do our bidding. Small mistakes in programs or spells can lead to completely unforeseen behavior: e.g., see the story, "The Sorcerer's Apprentice".

The purpose of brakes on a car is to allow you to go fast. Although the gas pedal makes you go fast, the brake pedal allows you to drive safely while going fast. The purpose of a strict compiler (one that performs type checking, uninitialized variable checking, reachability analysis, etc.) is to allow you to program fast. Programmers -like all humans- have limited intellects: when they focus on one aspect of a program, they must ignore others. Focusing on the right aspect at the right time is critical. By understanding those aspects that the compiler can check, you can ignore them, and focus on more important ones. Some programmers think that such an approach is reckless; they believe that you must pay close attention to everything at once. They are right -for them; but I'm just not that smart, so I must use my tools more effectively.

The structure of a software system provides the ecology in which code is born, matures, and dies. A well-designed habitat allows for the successful evolution of all the components needed in a software system.

The three most important aspects of debugging and real estate are the same: Location, Location, and Location.
- R. Pattis

There is a famous rule in performance optimization called the 90/10 rule: 90% of a program's execution time is spent in only 10% of its code. The standard inference from this rule is that programmers should find that 10% of the code and optimize it, because that's the only code where improvements make a difference in the overall system performance. But a second inference is just as important: programmers can deoptimize the other 90% of the code (in order to make it easier to use, maintain, etc.), because deterioration (of performance) of that code won't make much of a difference in the overall system performance.
- R. Pattis

When debugging, novices insert corrective code; experts remove defective code.

When teaching a rapidly changing technology, perspective is more important than content.
- R. Pattis

When building a complex system, having crackerjack programmers (who can make any design work, even a bad one) can be a liability. The result, after lots of effort, is a working system that cannot be easily maintained or upgraded. Good -but not great- programmers would fail early, causing a realization that the system must be redesigned, and then reimplemented. The extra cost is paid once, early in the system's cycle (when it is cheap), instead of repeatedly paid late in the system's cycle (when it is more expensive).

Brick walls are there for a reason. The brick walls are not there to keep us out. The brick walls are there to show how badly we want something. Because the brick walls are there to stop the people who don't want something badly enough. They are there to keep out the other people.

I think it is inevitable that people program poorly. Training will not substantially help matters. We have to learn to live with it.
- A. Perlis

I think that it's extraordinarily important that we in computer science keep fun in computing. When it started out, it was an awful lot of fun. Of course, the paying customers got shafted every now and then, and after a while we began to take their complaints seriously. We began to feel as if we really were responsible for the successful, error-free perfect use of these machines. I don't think we are. I think we're responsible for stretching them, setting them off in new directions, and keeping fun in the house. I hope the field of computer science never loses its sense of fun.
- A. Perlis

It goes against the grain of modern education to teach students to program. What fun is there to making plans, acquiring discipline, organizing thoughts, devoting attention to detail, and learning to be self critical.

Knowledge of a subject means knowledge of the language of that subject, which includes not only what its words mean, but far more important, how its words mean. As one learns the language of a subject, one is also learning what the subject is. It cannot be said often enough that what we call a subject consists mostly, if not entirely, of its language. If you eliminate all the words of a subject, you have eliminated the subject. Biology is not plants and animals. It is language about plants and animals. History is not events. It is language describing and interpreting events. Astronomy is not planets and stars. It is a way of talking about planets and stars.
- N. Postman

Gates has always understood Moore's Law better than anyone else in the industry. If you can make something run at all, get it out there -it may be slow and clunky, but hardware improvements will bail you out. If you wait until it's running perfectly on the hardware already in the field, it will be obsolete before it's released. This philosophy built Microsoft and is the main reason Microsoft won the war IBM declared back in the OS/2 days.

The underlying complexity of a given problem is constant. It can be hidden, but it does not go away. Complexity is conserved by abstractions. In fact, apparent complexity can be increased by abstractions, but the underlying complexity can never be reduced.

Computer Science education cannot make anybody an expert programmer any more than studying brushes and pigment can make somebody an expert painter.
- E. Raymond

Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow (e.g., given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix will be obvious to someone). (also see "The honest truth..." by B. Joy).

Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to use. [I'd add: Exceptional programmers know how to write code that others can use. -REP]
- E. Raymond

Ugly programs are like ugly suspension bridges: they're much more liable to collapse than pretty ones, because the way humans (especially engineer-humans) perceive beauty is intimately related to our ability to process and understand complexity. A language that makes it hard to write elegant code makes it hard to write good code.
- E. Raymond

Computer Science is the first engineering discipline in which the complexity of the objects created is limited solely by the skill of the creator, and not by the strength of raw materials.

I remember when McFarland wanted to expose the little children ... to the work of a sculptor, she gave these intructions to the artist ..., "I don't want you to teach them sculpting. All I want you to do is to love clay in front of the children". And that's what he did. The children caught his enthusiasm for it, and that's what mattered. Like most good things, teaching has to do with honesty.
- F. Rogers (in M. King's "The Good Neighbor: The Life and Work of Fred Rogers") pg. 138

One of the major goals of education must be to help students discover a greater awareness of their own unique selves, in order to increase their feelings of personal worth, responsibility, and freeedom.

Questions are the important thing, answers are less important. Learning to ask a good question is the heart of intelligence. Learning the answer---well, answers are for students. Questions are for thinkers.
- R. Schank (in "The Connoisseur's Guide to the Mind")

There is one very good reason to learn programming, but it has nothing to do with preparing for high-tech careers or with making sure one is computer literate in order to avoid being cynically manipulated by the computers of the future. The real value of learning to program can only be understood if we look at learning to program as an exercise of the intellect, as a kind of modern-day Latin that we learn to sharpen our minds.
- R. Schank (in "The Cognitive Computer")

Always do the hard part first. If the hard part is impossible, why waste time on the easy part? Once the hard part is done, you're home free.
Always do the easy part first. What you think at first is the easy part often turns out to be the hard part. Once the easy part is done, you can concentrate all your efforts on the hard part.

The skill of writing is to create a context in which other people can think.

Machines are simple: a hammer, a door hinge, a steak knife. Systems are much more complicated; they have components, feedback loops, mean times between failure, infrastructure. Digital systems are daedal; even a simple computer program has hundreds of thousands of lines of computer code doing all sorts of different things. A complex computer program has thousands of components, each of which has to work by itself and in interaction with all the other components. This is why object-oriented programming was developed: to deal with the complexity of digital systems...systems have bugs. A bug is a particular kind of failure...It's different from a malfunction. When something malfunctions, it no longer works properly. When something has a bug, it misbehaves in a particular way, possibly unrepeatable, and possibly unexplainable. Bugs are unique to systems. Machines can break, or fail, or not work, but only a system can have a bug.
- B. Schneier (in Secrets & Lies: Digital Security in a Networked World).

Microsoft knows that reliable software is not cost effective. According to studies, 90% to 95% of all bugs are harmless. They're never discovered by users, and they don't affect performance. It's much cheaper to release buggy software and fix the 5% to 10% of bugs people find and complain about.

I think that there is a need for more CS textbooks. Web content and other modern artifacts are important, but I believe a textbook written by an expert who is trying to lay out what a student can reasonably learn about a subject in a semester is still a critical component and a basis for effectively disseminating knowledge.

[On being asked, "How do we hold on to dreams that, statistically, are impossible (like aspiring to be Supreme Court Justice)?"] ... Experience has taught me that you cannot value dreams according to the odds of their coming true. Their real value is in stirring within us the will to aspire. That will, wherever it finally leads, does at least move you forward. And after a time you may recognize that the proper measure of success is not how much you've closed the distance to some far-off goal but the quiality of what you've done today.
- S. Sotomayor (in "My Beloved World" pp. viii)

I told him [a cousin] how I had been dazzled by his brilliance and his limitless curiosity about how the world works. And how I despaired of ever matching up to him. He looked at me and shook his head. "You don't understand, do you? I've always been in awe of you. There was nothing you couldn't learn if you set your mind to it. You would just study until you figured it out. ... The determination you have is special. It's a different kind of intelligence."
- S. Sotomayor (in "My Beloved World" pp. 151)

I've spent my whole life learning how to do things that were hard for me. None of it has ever been easy. ... I've honestly never felt fully prepared at the outset. Yet each time I've survived, I've learned, and I've thrived. I'm not intimidated by challenges. My whole life has been one. I look forward to enganging in the work [a judgeship] and learning how to do it well.

Computers do not solve problems -computers carry out solutions, specified by people, to problems.

EMACS could not have been reached by a process of careful design, because such processes arrive only at goals which are visible at the outset, and whose desirability is established on the bottom line at the outset. Neither I nor anyone else visualized an extensible editor until I had made one, nor appreciated its value until he had experienced it. EMACS exists because I felt free to make individually useful small improvements on a path whose end was not in sight.

In engineering, as in other creative arts, we must learn to do analysis to support our efforts in synthesis. One cannot build a beautiful and functional bridge without a knowledge of steel and dirt, and a considerable mathematical technique for using this knowledge to compute the properties of structures. Similarly, one cannot build a beautiful computer system without a deep understanding of how to "previsualize" the process generated by the code one writes.

A programming language is a system of notation for describing computations. A useful programming language must therefore be suited for both description(i.e., for human writers and readers of programs) and for computation (i.e., for efficient implementation on computers). But human beings and computers are so different that it is difficult to find notational devices that are well suited to the capabilities of both.
- R. Tennant (Principles of Programming Languages, Prentice Hall, 1981)

Real education happens only by failing, changing, challenging, and adjusting. All of those gerunds apply to teachers as well as students. No person is an "educator," because education is not something one person does to another. Education is an imprecise process, a dance, and a collaborative experience.
Education is the creation of habits of thought and methods of inquiry that yield unpredictable results. We offer diplomas to people upon completion of a rigorous and diverse set of intellectual experiences, not the mere accumulation of a series of facts and techniques. Education is certainly not an injection of information into a passive receptacle.

The computer programmer ... is a creator of universes for which he alone is the lawgiver ... universes of virtually unlimited complexity can be created in the form of computer programs. Moreover ... systems so formulated and elaborated act out their programmed scripts. They compliantly obey their laws and vividly exhibit their obedient behavior.

It is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all the copybooks, and by eminent people when they are making speeches, that we should cultivate the habit of thinking what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case. Civilization advances by extending the number of operations which we can perform without thinking about them. Operations of thought are like cavalry charges in a battle -they are strictly limited in number, they require fresh horses, and must only be made at decisive moments.

As soon as we started programming, we found out to our surprise that it wasn't as easy to get programs right as we had thought. Debugging had to be discovered.

Complexity has and will maintain a strong fascination for many people. It is true that we live in a complex world and strive to solve inherently complex problems, which often do require complex mechanisms. However, this should not diminish our desire for elegant solutions, which convince by their clarity and effectiveness. Simple, elegant solutions are more effective, but they are harder to find than complex ones, and they require more time, which we too often believe to be unaffordable
- N. Wirth

It is a sad manifestation of the spirit of modern times, in which an individulal's pride in his/her work has become rare. The idea that one might derive satisfaction from his or her successful work, because that worrk is ingenious, beautiful, or just pleasing, has become ridiculed. Nothing but economic success and monetary reward is acceptable. Hence our occupations have become mere jbos. But quality of work can be expected only through personal satisfaction, dedication, and enjoyment.
- N. Wirth

Increasingly, people seem to misinterpret complexity as sophistication, which is baffling -the incomprehensible should cause suspicion rather than admiration. Possibly this trend results from a mistaken belief that using a somewhat mysterious device confers an aura of power on the user.

Cutler, armed with a schedule [for finishing MS Windows NT], was urging the team to "eat its own dog food." Part macho stunt and part common sense, the "dog food diet" was the cornerstone of Cutler's philosophy. "We're going to run on the program we build," he insisted. Eating dog food meant there would be no escape from facing the flaws and imperfections of NT. Even while immersed in his own piece of NT, a code writer would confront all of its weaknesses. By controlling the operations of a code writer's computer, NT would define the quality of his life. If at first NT tasted no better than dog food, all the better. Code writers would feel an urgent need to raise the dietary level by quickly fixing the errant code and writing more durable code in the first place.
